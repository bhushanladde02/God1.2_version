It is an organization which brings together and inspires many castes and sub – castes under the veershaiva society, which worships lord shiva (Shankar).

This organization has got inspired by Mahatma Basweshwara Teaching to eradicate casteism and to establish. Shiva culture is the main objective of “shiva organization “ It includes all casts and sub casts lke veershaiva lingayat is Dikshawant Chilwant and rakshawant.

They have Inclusive and for load approach of shiva culture so “Shiva Maharashtra Veershaiva Yuvak Sanghatana cannot for treated as an organization following casteism. This organization any political party.But People who support any political thought or Party can be a part of this Orgnization Shiva Organization believes in not being and part. of any political party directly or indirectly during elections. I would request people not to belives anyone claiming that Shiva organization has connections with any political party.

If a question is raised whether only youth can be a member of this organization I would say no We want people who are young not by age but by heart. Any person who is old by age, and young by heart and active to work is welcomes in Shiva.
Youth should be active in shiva and experts are welcome to give their valuable advice and suggestions to Shiva.

Shiva focuses its attention on reduction of inequalities and differences on the basis of cast and religion or atrocities in the society. If the members of Shiva are discriminated for being veershaivas by cast, we won’t to tolerate such discrimination, we all follow the manner of democracy for such opposition to discrimination. But if our rights are still not protected, we would be involved in an open outrage on words to oppose it there is no discrimination on the basis of gender which poor criterion. Mahatma Basweshar had given his thoughts about inspiring their own self. By promoting their talent. The youth should be encouraged to work selfishly to develop the society. This is goal of our organization.

The Veershaiva youth is facing the problem of economic backwardness, education and an employment .this is reason why they are misdirected and dependent on others. This has created dissatisfaction and insecurity in their minds. They are restricted by their bad habits and forgetting the rich nalues of our own culture our organization is focused to find solutions on these social, educational, financial religious, political and industrial issues.
